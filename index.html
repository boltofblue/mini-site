            journey to pivot to become a full-stack developer with hopes of one day producing video games. My prior experience working as a Customer Success Manager at various SaaS companies and tech startups has equipped me with strong
            communication
            skills, a knack for problem-solving, and a deep sense of understanding and empathy when it comes to customers wants and needs. I am now
            harnessing my creativity and technical aptitude to craft captivating and user-friendly web experiences,
            blending my proficiency in soft skills with coding prowess to create innovative digital solutions that engage and
            inspire while keeping usability and accessibility in mind. Eager to embrace this new chapter, I am committed to continuous learning and contributing to the
